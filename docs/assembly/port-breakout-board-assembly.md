# Port Interface Board
![](../images/port-interface-board.png)
Each port interface board connects one infrared photo-gate, one LED and one solenoid valve with the Bpod state machine via an Ethernet cable.

## Assembly
1. Solder the parts on to the board (through-hole version shown). Begin with the 3 resistors. Make sure their values match the values printed on the board. Next, solder the blue potentiometer, the 6-position screw terminal connector, the 2-position connector, and finally the Ethernet jack.

# General build guide
The Assembly section contains supporting information for assembling Bpod state machines, peripheral modules, and other peripheral hardware.

Devices are assembled by soldering components from the bill of materials to their matching locations indicated  on the printed circuit board. A more in-depth assembly guide is provided for the Bpod Finite State Machine [here](../assembly/state-machine-assembly-0_5.md), and can be extrapolated to any Bpod device.

The different devices are accessed from the navigation bar on the left.
